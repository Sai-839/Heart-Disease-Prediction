# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project predicts heart disease using a CDC dataset, with Tableau for visualization and SAS E-Miner for modeling. Key risk factors like age, smoking, and BMI were identified as significant predictors. Several classification models were compared, including three Decision Trees and a Logistic Regression.
